## **Classy**

### _One_ place for all your assignments

The goal of Classy was to give a versatile and convenient place for you to access assignments from a variety of platforms in one simple clean environment. In its current state Classy is only an MVP with no _real_ data being imported from the actual user or _real_ login. the main purpose of this app was for me to learn a little bit of all aspects of mobile app development.
